USG retreat / internal workshop: every semester after elections (Article XIII, Section 84, ?)

Oct 17th

Use ACRONYM package.

Oct 22nd

DON'T ALLOW \paragraph, replace by parenum with preceding intro sentence

Define new `parenum` environment for ยง1, ยง2, etc (as in: \begin{enumerate}[label={\textbf{\S\arabic*}}])

Done - Oct 23 - Colin

Currently: \theenumi = \roman., \theenumii = \alph.
Then because \parenumi = \S\arabic* define \parenumii = \roman.

Oct 23rd

Currently there are three different section commands: 
 1) \section:
    this causes troubles (an empty line afterwards) when followed by an environment like lists (e.g. parenum)
2) \sectionstar
    this is like \section, but without the empty line afterwards
    however, there is no vertical space before the command, unless it is the first section of a chapter
3) \sectionss
    this is like \sectionstar, but with a vertical space before itself
    this should be used when the section title is followed by an environment and it is not the first section of a chapter
TODO: simplify this mess
at least the versions 2 and 3 should be unified to a single one
