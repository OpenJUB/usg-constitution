- Require everyone that runs to be a member of a committee beforehand?

- Secretaries: Two that take turn taking minutes, One that releases a report every 1 or 2 weeks (possibly member of the PR team)

- Create IT TEAM: Not just one person; two sysadmins who take care of day-to-day sysadmin activities, two developers who advance the voting system to
 -- allow sign-up for elections directly there
 -- are easier to maintain
 -- etc

- Create PR TEAM...
