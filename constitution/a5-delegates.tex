\article{Student Delegates}

The USG shall designate the \acp{USD} in all official matters and University Committees. The USDs present the USB's perspective and interests of the USB to the Academic Board as laid out in the Academic Constitution of Jacobs University Bremen. 

\section{University Committees with Undergraduate Student Representation}
The Committees in the \hyperref[USGexecutiveUnitDef]{USG Executive Unit} carry the task of delegating students to the following University Committees with Undergraduate Student Delegates. These USDs are mandated to join the respective University Committee. The USDs don't need to be members of the respective USG executive committee. In particular,
\begin{enumerate}
\item the Academic Affairs Committee is responsible for selecting delegates (and substitutes if necessary) for the:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Academic Senate (AS),
    \item University Committee on Education (UCE),
    \item University Committee on Quality Management (UCQM),
    \protect\item University Committee on Academic Integrity (UCAI),
    \item Teacher of the Year Delegates,
    \item Hiring Committees;
\end{enumerate}
\item the Campus Affairs Committee is responsible for selecting delegates (and substitutes if necessary) for the:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Equality Committee (EQ),
    \item Disciplinary Counsel (DC),
    \item College Council (CC).
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
Only in exceptional cases, as decided by the \hyperref[USGParliamentDef]{USG Parliament}, a student is allowed to be the Undergraduate Student Delegate (excluding substitutes) of more than one University Committee of Jacobs University.

\section{Decision-Making}
The USDs shall be free to vote in the University Committees as their consciousness dictates. The Student Parliament or the responsible Committee may however dictate the USDs' votes in their University Committees, by a simple 2/3 majority vote. If unable to attend the official meetings, the USD is responsible for finding a substitute.

\section{Tasks of the Undergraduate Student Delegates}
The Undergraduate Student Delegates shall:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item attend all meetings of their University Committee,
    \item attend all meeting of the responsible USG Executive Committee, unless decided so by the respective Committee,
    \item upon decision by the Parliament, additionally attend all meetings of the USG Parliament,
    \item present a summary of the work of the University Committee to the responsible Executive Committee and/or the Parliament, after each University Committee meeting or whenever asked to do so,
    \item at their discretion, or when mandated by the responsible USG Committee or the Parliament, invite other students as guests to the University Committee meeting.
